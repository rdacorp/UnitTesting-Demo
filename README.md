Unit Testing Lab
================

This lab will be the first module in our effort to move to a [behavior-driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) (BDD) methodology that works well with our focus on [disciplined agile delivery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciplined_Agile_Delivery) (DAD) focus.

Tools Needed
----------------

* Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 (2013 is preferred)
* [xUnit.net runner for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/463c5987-f82b-46c8-a97e-b1cde42b9099)

User Stories
----------------

Both BDD and DAD focus on user stories, and while we don't need them for this lab. They are being included as reference material.

* **US1**: As a user, I can choose to view all, active, or completed tasks.
* **US2**: As a user, I can add a task to my list.
